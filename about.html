            A generalist software engineer interested in a variety of
            technologies. These days I‚Äôm in the Cloud with a strong interest in
            all things web development and distributed systems, but you can also
            find me hacking on graphics and machine learning software when the
            opportunity arises. Of course everyone knows Linux and low level
            systems rock. I find myself most engaged when solving hard problems
            with code, a passion I‚Äôve kept throughout most of my life.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I‚Äôm not messing with bytes I like to draw and make music
            (Ableton of course, my favourite programming language). If you‚Äôd
            like to get in touch and chat, the best way is via my email or
            twitter. ‚úåÔ∏è
